## Rules to ensure training environments are safe ##

This folder contains some Google policy rules / IAM roles that make using trainings accounts somewhat safe against unintended cost spending. They are not really tested and probably not a watertight safeguard though. Use at your own risk.

## Best way to perform trainings with Google ##

Google [provides educational credits](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/edu-grants) for accredited institutions. Request well in advance of class schedule. You will receive a code for a tutor and a credit redemption link for students.

Students use the link to set up their own Google Cloud account. The credit appear as a means of payment and can be linked to a project they create. A credit card is not necessary. This way, students can make their first steps without bigger cost risks.
